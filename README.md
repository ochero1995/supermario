Super mario world 1 project

This is part of an ongoing project that aims at reproducing the Super Mario world one using HTML5, CSS, jQuery and JavaScript.
At this stage, the mario sprite is capable of moving 10px to the left, right and up the body of the page. Next stage will be
to recreate a proper moving sequence where all of the steps mario makes are animated.
